# Welcome to NicheSVM GUI: Unveiling Niche-Specific Gene Signatures in Tumor Microenvironments

NicheSVM GUI is an intuitive and user-friendly graphical interface for analyzing single-cell and spatial transcriptomics data, specifically designed to uncover niche-specific gene signatures within tumor microenvironments. This tool integrates cutting-edge computational techniques, including support vector machines (SVMs) and statistical analysis, to identify unique gene sets that characterize the interactions and expressions of neighboring cell types within a tissue microenvironment.

## About NicheSVM

NicheSVM GUI is an extension of the original NicheSVM framework, initially developed for Physically Interacting Cell sequencing (PIC-seq) analysis, which has been adapted to handle 10X Visium data seamlessly. The tool employs multiclass SVMs to deconvolve spatial transcriptomic data, allowing for the identification of gene sets specific to the cellular neighborhood within a given spatial spot. This concept introduces the idea of 'niche-specific genes,' whose expression is enriched when distinct cell types are co-localized within close proximity (approximately 55 micrometers) of each other.

## Key Features

- **Integration of scRNAseq and Spatial Transcriptomic Data:** NicheSVM GUI integrates single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNAseq) and spatial transcriptomic (ST) data in a way that is easy to understand. This makes it possible to look at gene activity in tissue samples in a complete way.
  
- **Niche-Specific Gene Analysis:** The tool employs statistical analysis to identify gene sets that are specific to cellular niches, providing valuable insights into cell-cell interactions and communication within complex tissue microenvironments.
  
- **User-Friendly Interface:** NicheSVM GUI offers an intuitive graphical user interface (GUI) built using MATLAB, making it accessible and easy to use for both researchers and practitioners, without requiring extensive programming expertise.

## How to Get Started

To begin using NicheSVM GUI and unravel unique niche-specific gene signatures in tumor microenvironments, simply follow the installation instructions and usage guidelines provided in the repository.

We invite you to explore the potential of this integrative approach and contribute to advancing our understanding of cell-cell communications within complex tissues. Happy exploring with NicheSVM GUI!
